Creating a new repo
--------------------
go to github and create anew repository
copy the URL for the newly created repository

open git bash CLI and use the following commands

>mkdir my-new-repo
>cd my-new-repo
>git init
>git add .
>git commit -m "First comment"
>git remote add origin master remote-repository-URL
>git remote -v
>git push origin master


After adding your project files,
Now its time to push the project(or update the remote master repo)
with your new content(project files)

>git add .
>git commit -m "your-comment goes here"
>git push origin master

Now you can happily browse your github account and share your project link with others
